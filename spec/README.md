# coho-sdk-spec

The shared material every Coho SDK is built and tested against. Each language's SDK copies what it needs from a tagged release of this repository, so all of them agree with the server and with each other.

Nothing here is edited by hand. Each file is produced by the Coho server's own code and copied here, so a fixture is exactly what a generator will receive.

Copied from coho-sdk-spec's working tree ahead of **v2026.1.0a9**, not yet tagged (2026-11-02): the type model at 1.7, with singletons and the `singletons` fixture, and delivery 2.1.0's recordings, among them `entry-with-assets`, `entry-with-repeater`, `entry-with-localized-items`, and `entry-with-nested-items`, whose `figure` and `outline` types and `citation`, `step`, `outlineSection`, `point`, and `note` components are in the delivery fixture. Copy a tagged release and name it here.

## The type model

A language-neutral description of one branch's or tag's content types. Code generators read it and write typed code: one type per content type, with the right fields, optionality, and reference targets. The server has already applied Coho's rules, so a generator never works them out for itself.

### Rules for generators

- **Versioning.** `irVersion` is `major.minor`. Ignore keys you do not know. Refuse a major version you do not support, and name both versions in the error. A minor version only adds optional keys or field kinds.
- **Optionality comes from `presence` alone.** `always` means delivery always includes the field; `maybe` means it can be absent. A localized field is `maybe` even when required, because delivery leaves it out wherever the requested locale has no translation.
- **Choice values are open.** Content can hold a value added after the file was produced. Generated code must accept an unknown value and keep it, not fail: in TypeScript, `'a' | 'b' | (string & {})`; elsewhere, an explicit unknown member carrying the raw value.
- **References name types in the same file.** Every slug in a reference field's `of` is a key of `types`. An empty `of` means the link points at an entry whose type this branch or tag does not have; generate it as an untyped entry.
- **Asset fields** (`kind: asset`, since 1.1) hold files: delivery embeds each asset as an object (`id`, `title`, `alt`, `focalPoint`, `file`, `url`, and for raster images `imageUrl`), never as a link to follow. `many` makes it a list. `accept` lists the media types a linked file may be, or family wildcards such as `image/*`, and is empty for any. **A single asset field is nullable whatever its `presence`**: an asset deleted on the branch or tag is delivered as `null`. In a list, a deleted asset is left out, never `null`. A field whose `accept` names only raster images (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`, `image/avif`, `image/heic`) may be typed as an image that always has dimensions; `image/*` includes SVG, which has none.
- **Repeaters hold component types** (since 1.2). `components` is keyed by slug, the same shape as `types`, and every slug in a repeater's `of` is a key of it. Each item carries `_id`, its stable identity, and `_type`, the component's slug: discriminate on `_type`. Content can hold an item of a component added after the file was produced. Leave such an item out of the list, and report it, rather than type it as something it is not; the TypeScript runtime does this from the generated `shape`. An empty `of` means no component type is on this branch or tag; generate items as untyped objects with `_id`. Before 1.2 there is no `components`, and items are untyped.
- **Types extend types** (since 1.3). A type with a parent names it in `extends`, a key of the same map (`types` or `components`); `abstract: true` marks a type no entry is of itself, only its descendants. A type's `fields` already include everything it inherits, so a generator that ignores `extends` stays correct. A field it reaches exactly as its parent has it carries `inherited: true`, for a language that declares it on the parent alone; one the type tightens (a narrower `values`, `of` or `max`, or made required) does not. **Delivery lists a type's descendants with it**: `?type=page` returns every service page and landing page too, each with its own `_type`, so a read or a link of a base type should be typed as any of the concrete types in its family. A reference or repeater whose `of` names a base type holds its descendants too.
- **Types take traits** (since 1.4). A trait is a named group of fields, in the top-level `traits` map; it is never a type, so no entry is of one and no `of` names one. A type lists every trait it has, its ancestors' first, in `traits`, and already has their fields in its own `fields`, each marked `trait` and as the type has it, which may be tighter than the trait's own. A generator that ignores traits stays correct. One that reads them may declare each trait once, `interface Seo`, and declare that every type with it has it, so code written against a trait accepts any entry that has one.
- **Lists are their own kind** (since 1.5). A field of `kind: list` is an array of plain values, each of the kind in `item`: `text`, `integer`, `number`, or `datetime`. Type it as a list of that kind (`readonly string[]` in TypeScript). `min` and `max` count its values. A localized list is delivered as the requested locale's array, and an empty array is a value, "none in this locale", where an untranslated locale leaves the field out, so `presence` still decides optionality. **Keep the two apart in generated code**: a missing localized list is absent (`undefined`, `None`, `null`), never an empty list, so "not translated" and "none here" read differently. A missing list that is not localized may read as empty, as a list of links does. A list is never sortable. References and assets keep `many`: a list is a kind of its own so that a generator that predates it types the field untyped, never wrongly as one value.
- **Component fields can be localized.** Delivery projects a localized field inside a repeater's item exactly as at the top level: one locale's value, absent where that locale has none. Such a field is `maybe`, as any localized field is, and needs nothing new from a generator.
- **Items hold items** (since 1.6). A component's field may be a repeater, so an item holds items, and a component may hold itself: a `menuItem` whose `children` are `menuItem`s. Generate a recursive type where the model recurses. Delivery projects localized fields at every level, and an entry nests items 5 deep at most. **Filter and hydrate at every level**: leave out an item of a component the code was not generated with wherever it is, not only in a content type's own repeaters, and report it, so a nested item is never typed as something it is not. Nothing in the shape changes, so a generator that predates 1.6 still types nested items, but filters only the first level.
- **A singleton has one entry** (since 1.7). `singleton: true` marks a content type with at most one entry on a ref, and `entrySlug` is the slug that entry answers to: the type's slug in kebab case, `siteSettings` to `site-settings`. Use `entrySlug`; do not derive it. Generate one getter in place of the type's list and read by slug. It reads `entries-by-slug/{entrySlug}` and returns the entry, typed as the type, or nothing before the entry is first written on the ref, as for any missing slug. A singleton is never abstract and never a component, and no type extends it, but it may extend a type, so a read of its parent still includes its entry. Delivery has no route of its own for it. A generator that predates 1.7 types a singleton as an ordinary type, which is still correct.
- **Unknown field kinds are untyped.** If `kind` is one you do not know, emit the field as untyped and print a warning. Never fail.
- **Print `warnings`.** When present, each one names a type and field that need attention.
- **Fields hidden from the API are already gone.** Do not look for them.

### File form

The type model is two-space-indented JSON with `"key": value`, one array element per line, `[]` and `{}` when empty, and a trailing newline: the layout of `JSON.stringify(model, null, 2)`. Tooling that writes the file in that layout produces no diff.

`source.schemaHash` is the SHA-256 of `types`, serialized compactly in the order given, or of `{"types": …, "components": …}` when `components` is not empty. Equal hashes mean equal types, whichever branch or tag they came from.

## Delivery recordings

Each file is one request to the delivery API and its answer, recorded from the server running against a fixed set of content. A delivery SDK replays them as its HTTP layer, so its tests check it against what the server actually sends.

```json
{
  "request":  { "method": "GET", "path": "/v0.0.1/entries-by-slug/chain-1?depth=2&locale=en-US", "auth": "key" },
  "response": { "status": 200, "headers": { "content-type": "…", "cache-control": "…", "etag": true }, "body": { … } }
}
```

- `path` is relative to the project's base URL, `…/v1/projects/{project}`. Compare the query as a set: an SDK may send the same parameters in another order.
- `auth` is `key` for the project's delivery key, `none` for no `Authorization` header, and `other-key` for a valid key that grants a different project.
- `etag` says whether the response carried one. The value is not recorded, because it changes every time the content is rebuilt; a replaying SDK can make up its own.
- The content is a type, `article`, with a localized `title`, a `body`, an integer `rank`, and a `related` reference. Three entries, `chain-1` to `chain-3`, link in a loop, and `chain-2` also links to an entry that does not exist. Four more, `entry-1` to `entry-3` and `entry-fr`, carry translated titles. A second type, `notice`, declares an integer `priority` and a text `message`, and has no entries. A third, `figure`, has asset fields: `image` (images only), `poster` and a `gallery` list. `figure-1` links a JPEG with a focal point, an SVG, a PDF, and an asset that does not exist, in `poster` and in `gallery`. `figure` also has `sources`, a repeater of the component type `citation`, and `figure-2` holds two citations. And `figure` has `steps`, a repeater of the component `step`, whose `label` is localized, `keywords`, a localized list of text, and `sizes`, a list of integers: `figure-3` has two steps, one labelled in `en-US` and `de-DE`, the other in `en-US` and `it-IT`, keywords in `en-US` and none on purpose in `de-DE`, and sizes `[3, 5]`. A fourth type, `outline`, holds items inside items: `outline-1` has one section, of the component `outlineSection`, with a localized `heading`, `points`, a repeater of `point`, which holds `point`s in its `children`, three levels deep, each `text` localized and the third only in `pt-BR`, and `notes`, a repeater of `note` localized as a whole, one note in `en-US` and none in `de-DE`.

| Recording | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `entry-by-slug`, `entry-by-slug-depth-1`, `entry-by-slug-depth-2` | One entry's references at depths 0, 1 and 2: `depth` at the boundary, `absent` for the missing entry, and the loop back to the root |
| `entry-by-id-de` | A read by id, projected to `de-DE` |
| `entries-by-id` | A read of several ids, one of which does not exist |
| `entries-ordered` | A page ordered by `-rank`, with more to come |
| `entries-fr` | Every entry projected to `fr-FR`, where most titles are untranslated and so absent |
| `entries-empty-type` | A type with no entries, ordered by its declared field: an empty page, not a refusal |
| `entry-with-assets` | Assets embedded (delivery 2.1.0): an image with `imageUrl`, an SVG and a PDF without one, a missing asset as `null` in `poster` and left out of `gallery`, and the `warnings` that name it. The project id in URLs is `{project}` |
| `entry-with-repeater` | Repeater items as stored: each with its `_id` and `_type`, the second's `_type` filled in by the server on write |
| `entry-with-localized-items` | `figure-3` in `de-DE`: the first step's label projected to German and the second's left out, an empty `keywords` list, and `sizes` |
| `entry-with-nested-items` | `outline-1` in `en-US`: points three levels deep, each `text` projected and the third's left out, and the section's `notes` as the `en-US` list |
| `entry-not-found`, `ref-not-found`, `invalid-query`, `key-required`, `project-not-found` | The refusals |

## Type model fixtures

| Fixture | Covers |
|---|---|
| `cli-next-blog` | text, longText (plain and markdown), choice, multichoice, datetime, integer, boolean, localized fields, single and many references, and a type that references itself |
| `delivery-fixture` | The types of the delivery recordings' content, `article`, `notice`, `figure` and `outline`, and the components `citation`, `step`, `outlineSection`, `point` and `note`, so a generator's output can be run against the recordings |
| `assets` | asset fields (single and many, image-only and any file), `number`, `json`, and a repeater whose components are not on the tag |
| `repeaters` | component types (1.2): a single-component repeater of `citation`, and a required repeater holding two components and one not on the tag |
| `traits` | traits (1.4): `seo` taken by `page` and inherited by `article`, which tightens its meta title, and `publishing` and `socialCard` taken by `article`, `socialCard` by an unrelated `person` too |
| `lists` | lists (1.5): a localized list of text with a `max`, lists of numbers and of date-times, one required with a `min`, and lists inside a component, one of them localized |
| `nested` | items inside items (1.6): a `page` of `section`s holding `card`s, and a `siteNavigation` whose `footerLinks` are `menuItem`s, each holding `menuItem`s, with translated labels, and whose `topNavigation` is a list per locale of `localeMenuItem`s, which hold themselves too and have plain labels |
| `singletons` | singletons (1.7): `siteSettings`, with a link to `homePage`, a singleton that extends `page`, so a read of `page` includes it |
| `inheritance` | type inheritance (1.3): an abstract `page`, `servicePage` and `landingPage` extending it, `premiumService` extending `servicePage` with a narrower choice, a `menu` linking to `page` and to `servicePage`, and an abstract component `block` with two components extending it, held by a repeater of `block` |
